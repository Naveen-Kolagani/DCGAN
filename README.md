# DCGAN
<h3>This repo shows an implementation of DCGAN on MNIST dataset</h3>
<p>This code is slightly modified version of the actual code <a href="https://github.com/llSourcell/Generative_Adversarial_networks_LIVE">from another repo</a></p>
<p>It generates hand written digits of MNIST dataset.</p><br>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<h3>Use a GPU or cloud platform like Google Colaboratory which is free to run the jupyter notebook file cause GPU is x10 times faster than CPU.It will take a minimum of 4 hours to run on a CPU</h3>
